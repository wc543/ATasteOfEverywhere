      <h2>How we Curate our Flights</h2>
      <p>
      Each selection of plates from a specific region can be ordered as a flight to give you
a general taste of the region as determined by the foods the locals eat often or for
celebrations. The Chef may also propose named flights that take you on a world tour 
of a specific ingredient or cooking method. For example, slow cooked beans are found in
many parts of the world, and a flight may highlight how different cultures have treated
this basic ingredient and cooking method. Similarly, wrapping a minced filling in dough
is a common thread among Samosas, dim sum, ravioli, gyoza, empanadas and pasties. Feel 
free to find a thread among the small plate offerings and pull together your own flight!
